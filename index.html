    <h1>Introducing Apex Ping</h1>
    <p>I'd like to introduce Apex Ping! A minimalistic, but powerful uptime &
      performance monitoring service for websites and APIs. In this post I'll
      cover features of Apex Ping, why I chose to build it first, and a few things
      I learned in the process. In future posts I'll be detailing the
      implementation for anyone who is curios.
    </p>
    <p>I soft-launched Ping about a month ago, built almost 100% on AWS Lambda.
      with over 500 users it has already detected over a million errors, and
      performed over 25 million checks. Big thanks to the early adopters who have
      checked it out!
    </p>

    <h2>The Product</h2>
    <p>I've seen first-hand how embarassing it can be when customers find out
      your product is having issues before you do, naturally this can translate
      to customers bailing on your product. ensuring your site, app, or API
      is stable and performant is critical.
    </p>
    <h3>Powerful Monitoring</h3>
    <p>Unlike some other uptime monitoring services, which only support HEAD
      requests, Apex Ping support header fields and bodies as well. This allows
      you to test APIs, caching behaviour, and serving time, as well as the
      typical connection latency.
    </p>

    <p>The checks listing displays the uptime, mean reasponse, Apdex score, and
      Apdex schore throughout the day, week, or month. The Apdex score
      generalizes the user experience, summarizing response time satisfaction and
      error responses.
    </p>

    <h3>Global checks</h3>
    <p>Requests or "checks" are performed from a number of selectable PoP's (Point
      of Presence), giving you a glance at the customer experience all over the
      world. Hovering a PoP provides you with the breakdown, and coloring indicates
      their relative health so you can instantly see if a region's availability or
      performance is degraded.
    </p>
    <h3>Latency Distribution</h3>
    <img src="tj_blog_img4.png">
    <p>When latency is a reflection of the user experience, it's important not to
      ignore the outliers. The Latency view provides you with an intuitive look at
      distribution throughout the selected time period, where the intensity of the
      heatmap represents the number of check's within the given duration.
    </p>
    <h3>Errors & Apdex</h3>
    <p>The Apdex(Application Performance Index) score quantifies the user-experience
      based on a configured target latency. It effectively lets you know how far
      you are from hitting your mark, you should strive for a perfect1 1.0!
